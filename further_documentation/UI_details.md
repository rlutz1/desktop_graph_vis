# User Interface Details

Any and all notes on the technical details of the UI can be read as desired below.

## UI Library

### Tkinter 

Current rendition of this application will simply use Tkinter as an easier way to build out a front end. There is an eye for something better (PyQT5 considered) or for replacing with a website, however this will work for some general ideas first.

<a href = "https://github.com/rdbende/Forest-ttk-theme">This theme</a> is used on top of Tkinter for a more modern feel. Much love to those devs.
